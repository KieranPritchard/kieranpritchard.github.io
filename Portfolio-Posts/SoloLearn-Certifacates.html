            An overview of the certifacates I have earned using SoloLearn, it is a app similar to Duolingo that teaches people how to program.
            This page is a working document as I passively use this app to learn new programming languages, all the time.

                        This was not only the first certifacate I earned with SoloLearn, but also how I learned my first programming language Python.
                        I found the structure of this course worked very well for me, first teach the theory behind it and then applying it.
                        In total this took me a little bit to complete, especially as refills for lives take five hours for one heart.

                        This was the second course I decided to tackle. 
                        My decision to learn a web devlopement langauge was based me wanting to do ethical hacking for a living, because I had read somewhere learning different programming languages was good thing to do for exploits.
                        On the other hand, it has paid off in the long as without it I wouldn't have been able to build this website.

                        The reason I decided to do this course, I had thought I learned how to structure a webpage why not learn to style it.
                        Dispete having skill to apply, I prefer to use bootstrap for building componants like navigation bars if possible.

                        If you have read this far your propably wondering, "Why did he pivot to C++ as his next langauge".
                        I saw on the internet it was one of the most used langauges in cyber-security, after research and seeing it on job posting's it seems a no-brainer.
                        However, this was before I found newer langauges like Rust and Golang became really popular.

                        This course I decided to do as I started at Bournemouth and Poole college, the reason was because when it came time to devloping my website I wanted to include interactive elements.
                        However, I had completed a similar course on another platform but it didn't give me a certifacate so I went and did this as well.
