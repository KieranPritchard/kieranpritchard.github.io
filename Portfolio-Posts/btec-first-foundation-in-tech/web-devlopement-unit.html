            A complete overview of my time on Bournemouth & Poole colleges, "T-Level Foundation in Digital" course.
            This page takes a brief look at each of the different units these are: online world, technology systems, web design and portfolio devlopement, digital graphics, and networking.
            In the future I am planning on expanding this page to have sub pages on each topic and assignment.

                        When starting out in this unit we were breifed on the different acpects of web design and portfolio devlopement.
                        These include planning, layouts, content, and styling. This also included short sessions on html, css and the bootstrap framework.
                        Which for the latter we spent a couple sessions exploring.

                        For the first asssignment, we were tasked with reviewing two different types of website via a presentaition.
                        I choosed to review are <a href="https://bruno-simon.com/">Bruno Simons Portfolio</a> and <a href="https://monkeytype.com/">Monkeytype</a>.
                        Using these two websites we were tasked with reviewing their intended use's and features; how the features improve it for example, how a feature aids accessiblity and performance; and finally, comparing their strengths weeknesses.
                        I gave my findings as a presentaition on canva after careful review of the websites I picked. However, we did not have to present it.

                        The focus of this assignment was to start to plan and design our portfolio website.
                        So to complete the tasks for this assignment we had to mock up and wireframe the website; gather our assets; timeblock the tests; and making the sitemap.
                        This assignment then laid the groundwork for me to be able to start devloping my website, as I used the plan for this assignment to build this website you see here.

                        This third assignment then had us building our websites. We were given the option of ether using no-code options like google sites or coding it ourselfs, I decided on the second option.
                        So, over the christmas hoilday before the assignment was properely handed out i got building the website. for the tech stack i used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and bootstrap. For the assignment tasks we were had to create the website; choose assets that are relvelant; test it using the pior made test plan; gather feedback and refine the webiste.
                        The website which i made for this assignment is the one that you are on right now.

                    <p>
                        Finally, the fourth and final assignment. The final task we had to complete involved reviewing the website againist the user requirements; how the feedback allows us to meet it; and then recommendations for improvement.
                        Because of this task the overall assignment was very short and more like a reflection on how the unit went and the evolution of the website.
                        It then allowed for me to use some of the feedback and the recommendations i had to give for myself to use as a starting point for me to further improve it.
