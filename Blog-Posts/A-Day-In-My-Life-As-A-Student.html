            A view into my world, my current routines, thoughts on college life. 
            I have also included accounts of changes to my life since going to college, 
            including how it has benefited me massively in the long run and the experences it's opened up for me.

        <h2 class="blog-post-page-heading">Morning Routines & First Lesson</h2>
        <div class="container-fluid">
            <p>
                On an average college day, I usually get up early so I've got enough time to get ready and catch the bus nothing too special, just the usual morning stuff. 
                I don't eat breakfast though, I prefer to wait until later in the day.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once I'm on the bus, I either talk to one of my friends who's on a different digital course, or I'll put in my earphones and zone out with some music. 
                It just depends on how I'm feeling that morning. If i do listen to music i either listen to pop music and some electronic music, like Chappell Roan, Depeche Mode, or anything else i like.
                if i'm not listening to that sort of music i'm listening to rock and metal groups like Sleep Token, My Chemical Romance, Linkin Park, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I get to college, I usually grab either a coffee or a milkshake, depending on my mood, and then head to my first lesson. 
                What I have first depends on the day because some days it might be learning about technology systems, other days I'll be trying out digital tools, working on assignments, or watching one of the college's required presentations on different topics which i dislike because its all stuff people should be aware of.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the first lesson, there's a break. Sometimes it's a long one, other times it's really short, but one thing that's always consistent is GCSE English lessons are right after. 
                I don't have loads to say about those lessons, but I enjoy them. It's a nice switch-up from all the tech stuff.

        <h2 class="blog-post-page-heading">Lunch Time</h2>
        <div class="container-fluid">
            <p>
                After the set of morning lessons, it's usually time for lunch. However, not every day follows the same pattern. 
                Some days I don't go to lunch straight away because I have a lesson that runs a bit later, sometimes finishing just before or around midday. 
                On those days, I dont get lunch straight away. But when I do head off for lunch, I usually grab something from the college canteen. 
                Sometimes I'll get whatever hot food they've made that day, and other times I'll mix it up and head out to grab a takeaway, depending on how I'm feeling and what the weather's like.
            </p>
            <p>
                After I've sorted out food, I usually go to the quiet lunch club. 
                Because I don't really enjoy the canteen it's too loud, busy, and a bit overwhelming most of the time. 
                The quiet lunch club is a lot more relaxed and calm, which helps me recharge and feel more comfortable. 
                While I'm there, I'll eat, catch up with friends who also go, and chat with the support staff who run it. 
                It's a good space to take a breather and just chill out before the rest of the day.
            </p>
            <p>
                Occasionally, instead of going to lunch club, I'll take a walk into Bournemouth town centre and do a bit of shopping—usually at HMV or CEX. 
                I don't do that too often though, as it depends on how packed my day is and whether I can squeeze it in around lessons. 
                But when I can, it's a nice change of pace. After lunch, it's back to college for the afternoon lessons.
            </p>

    <div class="blog-post-background-even align-content-center">
        <h2 class="blog-post-page-heading">Afternoon Lessons & Conclusion</h2>
        <div class="container-fluid">
            <p>
                When the afternoon comes around, my day can go one of two ways. 
                Sometimes, I finish early and head home, but on other days I stay for the whole afternoon, depending on the timetable. 
                The afternoon lessons are often the most interesting. 
                One day I might be using Photoshop to work on a creative task, and then the next I'm setting up virtual machines in a networking session. 
                Another day might be more research-based—learning about something new and then jumping into a bit of web development.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the things I really like about the course and college in general: every day feels different. 
                I'm always doing something new, and I'm not stuck in the same routine or forced into things I don't enjoy. 
                That freedom and variety even carries over when I'm back home.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I do get home, I don't completely switch off. I do wind things down a bit, but I'll still work on college assignments, tinker with programming projects, or even hop into a TryHackMe room to brush up on cybersecurity skills. 
                It's a balance between keeping productive and giving myself some breathing room.
            </p>
            <p>
                I hope this gives you a bit of insight into what my average day looks like as a college student—and maybe a little more than that.
            </p>
