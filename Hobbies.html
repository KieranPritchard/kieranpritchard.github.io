                    In late 2023, I attended a college open event.
                    While I was there, one of the tutors recommended two websites: SoloLearn and Codecademy.
                    Armed with these resources, I began learning how to code. Starting with Python, I gradually built my skills, which led to the tech stack I work with today.

                    Gaming has been a hobby that's stuck with me throughout my life.
                    Although I still enjoy it, many of the newer releases don't really interest me at the moment.
                    As a result, I often revisit older titles and games I'm already familiar with.
                    I also collect retro games for classic Nintendo handhelds, as well as newer generation consoles.
                    This may have played a role in sparking my interest in collecting physical media.

                    Like gaming, this is another passion that has stayed with me throughout my life.
                    I stopped collecting for a while before lockdown and sold off my DVD collection.
                    However, I continued collecting CDs and later got into vinyl.
                    Recently, I've started getting back into collecting films and TV shows.
                    This was sparked by the BBC losing episodes of Doctor Who due to rights issues and controversies, which led me to start collecting Blu-rays.
