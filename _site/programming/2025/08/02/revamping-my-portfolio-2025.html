            <h2 id="setting-my-goals">Setting My Goals</h2>

<p>After starting to get into a workflow of completing projects, reaching important milestones, or learning and then posting about them on LinkedIn to start making myself visible, I always come back to this website — my portfolio. I made it for one of my assignments at college this year for the website development unit. I think because of that, I didn’t get the time I wanted to really make it styled in the way I had wanted.</p>

<p>So I made a checklist to define what I wanted to add to this website and what improvements to make. I defined these as the things I wanted to include: better colour palettes for the dark and light mode (because the colours seemed too bright on dark mode to me and to others I’d asked for feedback); new sections for the About page, which I wanted to do originally; a favicon; and a lot more interactivity and consistency.</p>

<p>When I needed to test the changes, I would send the links to my friends for real feedback and thoughts on what I could do to make the website better. As a side ramble: I don’t like to give testers any guidance for things like websites. This is because I find it mimics what a real person visiting a website would do. I think this approach gives better feedback, because it lets them explore on their own and form their own opinions without needing to check off a list I send them on Discord or WhatsApp.</p>


        </div>
    
        
        <div class="blog-post-background-odd px-5 align-content-center">
            <h2 id="breathing-life-into-the-about-page">Breathing Life into the About Page</h2>

<p>The About page got the biggest transformation. I started by removing the blurb that said, “here are my top skills” to make room for the soft and hard skills sub-headings to go into their own columns. I then added more skills to reflect new things I’ve learned from my course and from my own studies into ethical hacking and cyber security.</p>

<p>I then decided I wanted a timeline for my important milestones on the website, which I had to unfortunately leave out before. I tried to find tutorials on how to use Bootstrap to do this, but I couldn’t find any that weren’t bloated with endless paragraphs. This is where I asked ChatGPT to generate an example that I could style and add to easily. I’m not going to go into my AI work ethics and rules here — but long story short, I like using it because it can explain new concepts to me in a way that I understand, especially because of my autism.</p>

<p>I also made a certification section to show off my badges and list the courses I’ve completed that have certificates. For example, my AWS Educate badges and OpenLearn cyber security course. I made a list for the certs that don’t have badges, and a row of badges for the courses that do.</p>

<p>I felt like including these would make the About page work better not just as a CV dump (which most of them are, if I’m being honest from what I have seen), but also as a timeline that I can easily update to highlight special moments in my professional journey.</p>


        </div>
    
        
        <div class="blog-post-background-even px-5 align-content-center">
            <h2 id="designing-for-experience-not-just-looks">Designing for Experience, Not Just Looks</h2>

<p>To create the colour schemes, I took the root colour variables I already had for light and dark modes and gave them to ChatGPT. I asked it to suggest new colours that still used some of the ones I already had. After some prompting, I got colours that complemented dark and light mode better and looked good in practice. The feedback definitely agreed.</p>

<p>I added a dark/light mode toggle to the navigation bar. This was included so users could choose for themselves, without their system mode dictating what the website should use. I wrote a new JavaScript function that switches between the two modes and saves the selection using the local storage API. This was because the website kept defaulting to the original selection whenever I switched pages.</p>

<p>As the last addition, I designed and created a custom favicon for the whole website. I made it in Canva, and my inspiration for the icon was an HTML tag. This helps give the site a bit more personality.</p>

        <div class="blog-post-background-odd px-5 align-content-center">
            <h2 id="giving-aws-educate-badges-their-own-space">Giving AWS Educate Badges Their Own Space</h2>

<p>Before this update, my AWS Educate badges and a singlur badge from a free open university course were only on my LinkedIn. I needed to show them on my portfolio too so that it would better represent my skill set and my acheivements and certifications.</p>

<p>I embedded them on the website, both on the About page in a new certifications sections and on a dedicated page within the Projects page.</p>


        </div>
    
        
        <div class="blog-post-background-even px-5 align-content-center">
            <h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h2>

<p>This refresh wasn’t just a design update, but a way to make the site more relevant to where I’m at right now. Now that my course is over, I’m finally able to work on it the way I want.</p>

<p>So, the plan is to keep adding new projects, skills, and more things so it grows alongside me — and doesn’t get left in the dirt.</p>
