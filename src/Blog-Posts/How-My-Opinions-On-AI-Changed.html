            A small introspective piece on how my opinions and views of AI have changed and grown 
            since the first realease of ChatGPT in November 2022, to the present day where it has become an part of everyones life to some extent.

        <div class="container-fluid" style="height: 85%;">
            <p class="h-100 align-content-center">
                When ChatGPT became a puplically released for the first in november 2022, i was at the time at a sixth-form getting my GCSE's.
                I can only describe my inital thoughts as skeptism with a hint of intrigue, the skeptism which i will talk about further on however, the intrigue was because now that we had created this how will it impact us.
                My prejduces and skeptisms with the technology were born out of me being a really into Sci-Fi. This is relevant because i think like most people i had only been exposed to the idea through t.v and film, particully The Matrix's machines, star wars droids, and 2001 A Space Oddeysee.
                Something you may have noticed with the films i have listed, apart of star wars, the depictions listed are very againist ai. this i believe has influced my opinions on the topic although, i will always try and see good in all things because you can't just write things off as being bad.
                You have learn more about it first which is what i did.

        <h2 class="blog-post-page-heading">Research and Shifting Opinion</h2>
        <div class="container-fluid" style="height: 85%">
            <p class="h-100 align-content-center">
                Furthermore, i started to research about the applications with this technology because of all the news storys on the internet involving it.
                to my surprise, i found out that it wasn't this one thing but a whole field of study and this field fueling advancements like machine learning. 
                because of this i learned about how its being used in our day to lives with digital assistents, robots, fraud prevention and more. 
                all of this paved the way for my opinions on the field to start changing, it was safe to say that my opinions on the subject started changing to become more open.
                i then started looking into what chatgpt could do and i could see myself using it however, something then happened which shifted my opinion of it back towards distain.
                This was because when i was sixth-form the head teacher that was there, tended to overuse it for everything. i was always aware there would be a chance of people overusing it However, this was the first and only time i say it being used like that.
                This caused the shift from beileving this technology was one of the best things to happen in modern day tech, to thinking it was bad.
                My opinion shifting back to this was because it was being used to make decisions for me for example, when i got a new time table it was very visibly made using ai.
                but after i had left there and i started at college again my opinion shifted back to it being good.

        <h2 class="blog-post-page-heading">Where I Am With It Now</h2>
        <div class="container-fluid" style="height: 85%;">
            <p class="h-100 align-content-center">
                When i first started at bournmouth and poole college, within hours of being there it was made clear to me i would have to learn it for my course.
                Quite quickly getting to use it in all of its glory i found it to be a good tool. 
                What i did find when using it however, i was being cautous not to overuse it because i dont want to do.
                because i like to try and solve problems myself before going after health, this is something i still maintain in doing.
                I would say i have a good relationship with it because of this mindset, to summarise try and solve a problem myself first still not solved then use it to help.
                On the other hand, it has proved to be a great general purpose tool i can't go without now. as it as helped me learn new things and improved my efficienty.
                I hope you enjoyed this introspective look into my expierences with AI, in the future i am hoping to build something fun to show off my ai skillset in my portfolio which will be linked below when it is build.
