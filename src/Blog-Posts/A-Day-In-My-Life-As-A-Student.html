        <div class="container-fluid" style="height: 85%;">
            <p class="h-100 align-content-center">
                On a college day I like to get up early in the morning, if not later on in the, because it gives me enough time to be able to get ready and catch the bus. 
                My morning routine is mostly the same as other people being I brush my teeth, and get washed and dressed. However, there is a major difference with me where I do no eat breakfast, but there is a reason for that. 
                when I get on the bus to college I do one of two things the first is I talk to one of my friends on one of the other digital courses, if not I listen to my music and zone out.
                When I arrive at college I like to get a coffee or a milkshake depending on how I'm feeling then go to lesson.
                For my first lesson of the day it depends on the day for example, one day I might be learning about technology systems, then another exploring the digital trying out new tools getting assignments done, or watching one of the colleges mandatory presentations on a variety of topics.
                After the first the lesson there is a break some days there are long and last hours some only last minutes. However the one constant is the gcse english classes that happen afterwards. I dont have much share on these, but I enjoy them.

        <h2 class="blog-post-page-heading">Lunch Time</h2>
        <div class="container-fluid" style="height: 85%">
            <p class="h-100 align-content-center">
                After the set of morning lessons it's time for lunch although, some days I dont go lunch straight away but that is due to me having to go to some lessons before midday.
                When I do go for lunch I like to get something from the canteen, sometimes I buy whatever they had made that day other days I might go out and get a takeaway.
                After I have gotten my lunch I then go to the quiet lunch club, because I have ASD I do not like the canteens and find them loud and too busy. 
                When I am at the lunch club I tend to eat, talk to friends, and the support staff that run it. sometimes I do other things like walking into bournemouth to go shopping at hmv and CEX however, those instances are few and far between due to slotting it in with lessons.
                After lunch is when the afternoon lessons begin.

            <p class="h-100 align-content-center">
                When the afternoon comes around. My day can either stop there and I go home, if not I am there for the whole afternoon.
                The lessons depending on the day tend to be the most interesting. For example, one day I might be working on something in Photoshop and then making virtual machines in networking.
                Another day might have me researching and learning about new things, then go onto to a some web devlopment. this is one of the things I like about the course and college in general,
                everyday is different I'm always doing something different and I'm not stuck doing things I dont want to do and that extends to home as well.
                When I go home I dont just stop working however, I do dial it down a little bit. I will work on assignments, program whatever projects im working on, and sometimes going on a room on Try Hack Me.
                I hope I have given you a insight into my day to day life as a college student and a little more.
