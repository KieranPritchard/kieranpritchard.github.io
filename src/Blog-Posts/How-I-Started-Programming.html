            This blog post is a look back on the start of my programming journey. 
            With this post I wanted to share to the masses about how i started, how began learning, and my personal tips as well as advice on how to get started.

                It was summer 2023 and I was attending an open event at Bournmouth and Poole college.
                I had gotten a couple of quaifactations from the sixth form I was at from my first year there, due to a personal problem I was planning on leaving as soon as I could.
                While I was at the event I met with one of the tutors for the "gateway to digital" course, we talked for the better part of 15 minutes about the course. 
                however, the best thing that came out of it was all the recomodations for websites and software to get me started on my programming journey.
                When I got home I started to get stuck in, I downloaded VS code and signed up to the platforms she recomdented to me.
                I will talk about them further down in the article, but for now let me share my first steps with learning this.

            <p class="h-100 align-content-center">
                I first signed up to a free platform called sololearn, it's similar to Duolingo but its for programming.
                The first course I worked on was called "Introduction To Python", during the lessons on this course I wrote down notes on everything to aid with recalling knowledge down the line.
                After I had completed this course and got a certifactate, my next aim was to start getting into building projects.
                Armed with knowlege and notes I built some projects, the projects were your simple "rock, paper, scissors" and password creators (these can be found on my github).
                I then learned HTML, CSS, and started on C++, unfortunately i had to stop due to the revision schedules I had been given not allowing much time for many breaks to do other things.
                However, once that was over I started to get back into programming. i will not lie it was hard but because I had notes and projects to look back on, I managed to bounce back hard.

                If your thinking about getting started with coding. Absolutely throw yourself into it I already gave you one platform to go onto to learn, another I can recommend is codecademy which is also free.
                this provides a more normal way to learn, unlike sololearn it allows you to learn javascript frameworks like react and they do general tech courses as well, but unlike sololearn certifacates aren't free.
                Something I recommend you to do when building projects is get an IDE (Integrated Devlopement Enviroment) instead of a notes app, also sign up to and use Git and GitHub as this will back up and version control your code and help with portfolio devlopement.
                I say about this because hands on projects count as expierence. 
                To those who are going to learn I wish you luck and hope your journey opens up many doors for you.
