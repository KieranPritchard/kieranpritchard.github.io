## Introduction To Python

                This was not only the first certifacate I earned with SoloLearn, but also how I learned my first programming language Python.
                I found the structure of this course worked very well for me, first teach the theory behind it and then applying it.
                In total this took me a little bit to complete, especially as refills for lives take five hours for one heart.

                This was the second course I decided to tackle. 
                My decision to learn a web devlopement langauge was based me wanting to do ethical hacking for a living, because I had read somewhere learning different programming languages was good thing to do for exploits.
                On the other hand, it has paid off in the long as without it I wouldn't have been able to build this website.

## Introduction To CSS

            <p>
                The reason I decided to do this course, I had thought I learned how to structure a webpage why not learn to style it.
                Dispete having skill to apply, I prefer to use bootstrap for building componants like navigation bars if possible.

                If you have read this far your propably wondering, "Why did he pivot to C++ as his next langauge".
                I saw on the internet it was one of the most used langauges in cyber-security, after research and seeing it on job posting's it seems a no-brainer.
                However, this was before I found newer langauges like Rust and Golang became really popular.

                This course I decided to do as I started at Bournemouth and Poole college, the reason was because when it came time to devloping my website I wanted to include interactive elements.
                However, I had completed a similar course on another platform but it didn't give me a certifacate so I went and did this as well.
