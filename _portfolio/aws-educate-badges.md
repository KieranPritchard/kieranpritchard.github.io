                I first heard about AWS Educate from a few TikToks saying it’s essential for anyone in the tech industry to sign up, especially with the rise of cloud computing. I decided to give it a try because I wanted to understand the basics as almost every cybersecurity job description I see these days asks for some cloud knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
                The course introduced me to the fundamentals of cloud computing and AWS. It covered topics like what cloud computing is, its pricing benefits, how it can free up a company’s on-site resources, and how it helps startups launch more easily and cost-effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
                For me, this platform was a game changer. I wanted to learn cloud computing in a structured way without paying upfront, and AWS Educate gave me exactly that a clear and beginner-friendly learning experience.

## Getting Started With Storage

                After completing Cloud Computing 101, the platform encouraged me to move on to their “Getting Started With” pathway. This pathway consists of seven courses, each covering a different AWS domain, starting with storage.
            </p>
            <p>
                What I like about these courses is that the assessments include simple, hands-on tasks that reflect what you would actually do in a real-world environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started with “Getting Started With Storage”, which introduced me to AWS’s primary storage services: EBS, S3, and EFS. The course explained their different use cases—like EBS for EC2 instance storage, S3 for web applications and general object storage, and EFS for file storage across multiple instances.
            </p>
            <p>
                The final assessment required me to upload website files to an S3 bucket, configure permissions, and make certain files either private or publicly accessible from the internet.

## Getting Started With Compute

            <p>
                In this module, there isn’t a lot that is unique compared to other AWS Educate learning paths, as it follows the same structured approach to teaching cloud concepts. What sets it apart is its focus on compute services, particularly Amazon EC2. The course introduces the fundamentals of EC2, including launching and managing virtual servers, understanding instance types, and working with key configuration options. In addition to the theoretical knowledge, it provides substantial hands-on practice, allowing learners to experiment with creating, connecting to, and managing EC2 instances in a guided environment.

## Getting Started With Networking

        <div class="col-md order-md-1 order-first align-content-center">
            <p>
                After a short break, I completed Getting Started With Networking. This course provided hands-on experience with Amazon VPC, including how to connect multiple service instances within a network. I also strengthened my understanding of core networking concepts such as IP addresses, and explored more advanced topics like CIDR blocks and subnetting. A key insight was the importance of careful planning when designing networked applications, since many configuration decisions are permanent and can significantly impact scalability and performance.
