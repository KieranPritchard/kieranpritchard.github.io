                The Bronze Award was the first award I earned in the iDEA program. This award focused on introducing me to various digital skills and concepts.
                The modules covered topics such as digital citizenship, online safety, and basic digital literacy.
                This foundation helped me understand the importance of being responsible and ethical in the digital world.

                The Silver Award built upon the Bronze foundation and introduced more advanced digital skills.
                The sliver award was similer to the bronze, complete a set criteria of badges across now five different catagories.
                However the badges to complete this award require the user to complete more longer and more involved tasks.
                I found the gamer badges on this award to be my favorite as they required completing different puzzles to complete.
                Unfortunately, my learning with the platform stopped here, because the team behind havent launched gold award yet.
                However, you can start completing some of the new badges for gold.
