## Starting out

<div class="content-container container-fluid">
    <div class="row h-100">
        <div class="col-md align-content-center">
            <p>
                Our first two months of this assignment was based on watching presentaitions on how networks work and making our own cables.
                While i cant show you anything related to the powerpoints we watched i can show you images from the network cables that we made.
                As according to our teacher, it is an essentail skill to have in indrustry.
                It took me a few attempts to get it right but once i did i had a functioning network cable.
            </p>

        {% include carousel.html 
            images=page.starting_out_images 
            carousel_id="starting-out-carousel" %}
    </div>
</div>

## Assignment one: The Features and Uses of Computer Networking

<div class="content-container container-fluid">
    <div class="row h-100">
        {% include carousel.html 
            images=page.assignment_one_images 
            carousel_id="assignment-one-carousel" %}
        <div class="col-md align-content-center">
            <p>
                For this first assignment we had to make presentaition explaining the features of two seperate networks.
                To complete the task we had to explain two different uses and features of two types of network. 
                For example, why is a LAN used and what is the purpose of PAN. then we had to review how they affect the user expierence and disscuss their strengths and weeknesses.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

## Assignment two: Create the Design

<div class="content-container container-fluid">
    <div class="row h-100">
        <div class="col-md align-content-center">
            <p>
                For this assignment we were tasked with creating a design for a hypohetical network.
                This involved describing the client requirements and purpose; listing the costs and the parts; making a of the network diagram; test plan and data; making alternative solutions and justifing my choices.
                This was a very different second assignment from the others in the way that it wasnt building ontop of them in the same way.
            </p>
        </div>
        {% include carousel.html 
            images=page.assignment_two_images 
            carousel_id="assignment-two-carousel" %}
    </div>
</div>

## Assignment three: Develop and Test a Computer Network

<div class="content-container container-fluid">
    <div class="row h-100">
        {% include carousel.html 
            images=page.assignment_three_images 
            carousel_id="assignment-three-carousel" %}
        <div class="col-md align-content-center">
            <p>
                This assignment then had us creating a network using virtual machines with virtual box.
                as part of this task we were premade windows 10 and windows server 2019 virtual machines which we used to complete the tasks.
                the tasks we were given were: to make three network users; make five shared folders and files, give the network a shared hardware and software resource. gather feedback and give suggustions on how i would improve it.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

## Assignment four: Review The Network

<div class="content-container container-fluid">
    <div class="row h-100">
        <div class="col-md align-content-center">
            <p>
                for the final assignment. The final task we had to complete involved reviewing the network againist the user requirements; how the feedback allows us to meet it; and then recommendations for improvement.
                Because of this task the overall assignment was very short and more like a reflection on how the unit went and the evolution of the network.
