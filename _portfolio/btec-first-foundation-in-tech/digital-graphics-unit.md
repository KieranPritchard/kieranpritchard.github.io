## Starting Out

                We started the unit off with getting hands on with Adobe Photoshop. We did this by being given a tutor made course on the software; how it worked was we would watch a video on for example, the history brush and then do a task involving using it. Unfortunately, while we were supposed to also have training on illustrator we couldnt because the virtual learning enviroment wasnt being cooperative. I have selected a couple graphics i had made using this in the carosel below and feel free to scroll through.

## Assignment one: Investigate Two Different Graphics Products

        <div class="col-md align-content-center">
            <p>
                For this assignment we were tasked with reviewing two graphics products with different purposes. To complete the assignment we had to explain the intended purpose and features of the two products; review how the two are fit for their purpose; and discuss about their strengths and weeknesses. The two products i reviewed have a personal connection to me because The panic at the disco poster was from the first concert i went too and the infographic is to do with cyber security which is my career goal.

## Assignment two: Researching and Designing Digital Graphics

                This assignment tasked us with researching and designing a chocolate bar wrapper and a magazine advert for said chocolate. We first had to research and make moodboards for our planned moodboards; gather our needed assets; make alternative designs; annotaite our designs; and justify them. We planned and did most of the assignments on two custom made planning sheets. while the assets was on a seperate word document. Overall this made up the bulk of the planning the graphics.

## Assignment three: Create, Test, and Review Digital Graphics

<div class="content-container container-fluid">
    <div class="row h-100">
        {% include carousel.html 
            images=page.assignment_three 
            carousel_id="assignment-three" %}
        <div class="col-md align-content-center">
            <p>
                For the final assignment of this unit, we actually made our planned designs. 
                So we started by making our first designs and updating our assets where nessary.
                We then had to gather feedback and then build off of that to improve the products intill they were at their best.
                Then once the products were of a high enough quality we had to evalute the changes between them

                As part of practising photoshop we were also urged to explore AI images using canva.
                This was part of a task that we were part of which involved making graphics for new posters and desk accessorys that the college staff wanted to make.
