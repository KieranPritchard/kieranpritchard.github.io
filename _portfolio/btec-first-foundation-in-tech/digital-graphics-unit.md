## Introduction to Digital Graphics

                The Digital Graphics unit was one of the most challenging units for me, as it was the first time I had worked with professional graphic design software.
                This unit introduced me to Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, tools that are essential in the digital design industry.
                The unit focused on understanding graphic design principles, working with different file formats, and creating professional-quality graphics.

## Learning Adobe Photoshop

<div class="content-container container-fluid">
    <div class="row h-100">
        {% include carousel.html 
            images=page.photoshop_images

        <div class="col-md align-content-center">
            <p>
                Adobe Photoshop was the first software we learned in this unit. I found it quite challenging initially due to the complexity of the interface and the many tools available.
                We learned about layers, masks, filters, and various selection tools. The most interesting part was learning about non-destructive editing techniques that allow you to make changes without permanently altering the original image.
                We worked on several projects including photo retouching, creating composite images, and designing graphics for different purposes.

## Working with Adobe Illustrator

                Adobe Illustrator was the second major software we learned. Unlike Photoshop, which is primarily for raster graphics, Illustrator works with vector graphics.
                This means graphics created in Illustrator can be scaled to any size without losing quality. We learned about the pen tool, shape tools, and how to create logos and illustrations.
                The vector-based approach was quite different from what I was used to, but it opened up new possibilities for creating scalable graphics.

## Final Projects and Assessment

<div class="content-container container-fluid">
    <div class="row h-100">
        {% include carousel.html 
            images=page.final_images 
            carousel_id="final-carousel" %}
        <div class="col-md align-content-center">
            <p>
                For the final assessment, we had to create a portfolio of work demonstrating our skills in both Photoshop and Illustrator.
                This included creating a logo design, editing photographs, and producing graphics for different purposes.
                The assessment also required us to document our design process and explain the technical decisions we made.
                While this unit was challenging due to my lack of prior experience with these tools, it gave me valuable skills that I can use in future projects.
