## Starting Out

<div class="content-container container-fluid">
    <div class="row h-100">
        <div class="col-md align-content-center">
            <p>
                When starting out in this unit we were breifed on the different acpects of web design and portfolio devlopement.
                These include planning, layouts, content, and styling. This also included short sessions on html, css and the bootstrap framework.
                Which for the latter we spent a couple sessions exploring.
            </p>
        </div>
        {% include carousel.html 
            images=page.starting_out_images 
            carousel_id="starting-out-carousel"
            auto_advance=false %}
    </div>
</div>

## Assignment One: The Uses and Features of Websites

<div class="content-container container-fluid">
    <div class="row h-100">
        {% include carousel.html 
            images=page.assignment_one_images 
            carousel_id="assignment-one-carousel"
            auto_advance=false %}
        <div class="col-md align-content-center">
            <p>
                For the first asssignment, we were tasked with reviewing two different types of website via a presentaition.
                I choosed to review are <a href="https://bruno-simon.com/">Bruno Simons Portfolio</a> and <a href="https://monkeytype.com/">Monkeytype</a>.
                Using these two websites we were tasked with reviewing their intended use's and features; how the features improve it for example, how a feature aids accessiblity and performance; and finally, comparing their strengths weeknesses.
                I gave my findings as a presentaition on canva after careful review of the websites I picked. However, we did not have to present it.

## Assignment Two: Create a Design

<div class="content-container container-fluid">
    <div class="row h-100">
        <div class="col-md align-content-center">
            <p>
                The focus of this assignment was to start to plan and design our portfolio website.
                So to complete the tasks for this assignment we had to mock up and wireframe the website; gather our assets; timeblock the tests; and making the sitemap.
                This assignment then laid the groundwork for me to be able to start devloping my website, as I used the plan for this assignment to build this website you see here. 
            </p>
        </div>
        {% include carousel.html 
            images=page.assignment_two_images 
            carousel_id="assignment-two-carousel"
            auto_advance=false %}
    </div>
</div>

## Assignment 3: Create and test a Website

<div class="content-container container-fluid">
    <div class="row h-100">
        <div class="col-md align-content-center">
            <p>
                This third assignment then had us building our websites. We were given the option of ether using no-code options like google sites or coding it ourselfs, I decided on the second option.
                This assignment involved building the website; testing it against the original brief; gathering feedback; and making improvements based on that feedback.
                This website you are currently viewing is the result of this assignment, which I have continued to develop and improve since completing the course.
            </p>
        </div>
        {% include carousel.html 
            images=page.assignment_three_images 
            carousel_id="assignment-three-carousel"
            auto_advance=false %}
    </div>
</div>

## Assignment 4: Review the website

<div class="content-container container-fluid">
    <div class="row h-100">
        <div class="col-md align-content-center text-center">
            <img src="{{ '/res/Portfolio-Post-Images/btec-first-foundation-in-tech/Web-Devlopment/Web_Devlopement_Image_14.png' | relative_url }}" class="indivual-post-page-image d-block w-100" alt="Image showing part of the review report.">
        </div>
        <div class="col-md align-content-center">
            <p>
                Finally, the fourth and final assignment. The final task we had to complete involved reviewing the website againist the user requirements; how the feedback allows us to meet it; and then recommendations for improvement.
                Because of this task the overall assignment was very short and more like a reflection on how the unit went and the evolution of the website.
                It then allowed for me to use some of the feedback and the recommendations i had to give for myself to use as a starting point for me to further improve it.
