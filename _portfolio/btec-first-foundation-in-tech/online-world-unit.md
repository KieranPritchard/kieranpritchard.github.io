                At the start of the year. This unit was not very eventful, it was mostly starting to learn about how technology was used in the world.
                This took the form of online learning with KnowItAllNinja. This website allows teaches and helps its users to revise for the exams of btec digital courses.
                it does this by taking the user through a slideshow explaining the topic, then it has you answering multi choice questions to help revise and built your knowledge.

## Exploration of Tools and Software

            <p>
                As part of the course students were encouraged to try out new tools and software. 
                Two of my stand outs were Notebook LM, which is site that allows you to create notes from various sources using an LLM.
                The other one was ChatGPT, I wasnt using this before because I had differing opinions in the past as opposed to after joining college.
                There are many more things i have discovered in the mean time: Programming languages, Framworks, and AI tools

                The grade from this unit was based on a final exam, a pass. in the build up to the exams we were given text books and the KnowItAllNinja website to use in order to revise.
                What I liked about both exams was how they worked from user to user. What I mean by this was every user got a personalised exam, how it was explained to me was it pulled from a bank of questions and gave each user a random selection.
                However, what this did was give me was a question on a subject I was'nt confident with causing me to drop from merit to a pass on this unit.
