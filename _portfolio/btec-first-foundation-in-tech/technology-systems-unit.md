## Starting out

                Like The online world unit, this unit was also based around a final grade from an exam.
                However, unlike the prior unit this one was more based around its name being technology systems.
                So, in short this unit is about how the technology works and how the systems are in place as opposed to how the world use them.
                This unit started off with more presentaitions and powerpoints explaining the various topics, which i found to be useful when revising and explained things very well.

## Revising for Exam

            carousel_id="revision-carousel" %}
        <div class="col-md align-content-center">
            <p>
                The process for exam revision was the same as the previous unit using KnowItAllNinja and the supplied text books to revise and prepare for the exam.
                I felt more accustomed to this as opposed to the online world unit. I think this was due to this unit using concepts that I am familer with through programming for about a year beforehand.
                Unlike the previous unit, we werent encouraged to explore the technology as much as the online world unit. 
                This was due to the unit covering subjects that one could not just go and try out like CAD/CAM software as an example.

## The Exam

                Like the previous exams we were given text books to also revise, on top of having KnowItAllNinja.
                I enjoyed two things about this exam. 
                The first being the same as the previous exam being the randomised nature of it, but for this one the other was it allowed me to use my knowledge from programming and other tech systems related knowledge I have gained to be put to use.
                From where I can't show the exam questions I can show you the practise questions from the textbooks.
