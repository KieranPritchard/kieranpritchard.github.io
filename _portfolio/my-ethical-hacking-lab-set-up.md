title: "My Ethical Hacking Lab Setup"
description: "A full breakdown of how I set up my ethical hacking lab using VirtualBox on my laptop, where I installed both Ubuntu, which was to test virtual box, and Kali Linux for my ethical hacking lab. I go over fixing compatibility issues to getting internet access working, and I’ve included screenshots and notes on what I did throughout the process. (image generated by Gemini image tools)"

                I created this setup because I wanted to build a Kali Linux lab to practice and experiment with tools on platforms like TryHackMe. At the time, I didn’t have any way to access these platforms, so I decided to assess my needs. I settled on using virtual machines, which allowed me to boot up a lab environment whenever needed without purchasing additional hardware. This approach lets me use the lab on demand without affecting other parts of my host machine.

                My first goal was to get everything running on my MacBook using Ubuntu. VirtualBox installed without any issues, and I set it up in Expert Mode based on what I had learned in college. I downloaded an Ubuntu Server ISO image and loaded it into VirtualBox. However, it opened into the UEFI console. I began troubleshooting—first by searching online for fixes, and then by asking ChatGPT for help. Eventually, I realized I had downloaded the wrong image for my host machine's architecture. After installing the correct version, I created a user account and installed Guest Additions to enable internet access, which I tested by watching My Chemical Romance music videos on YouTube.

                I first downloaded a compatible Kali Linux image for my MacBook. I then loaded it into VirtualBox and allocated system resources to the virtual machine. After booting it up, I created a user account, installed Guest Additions, and made sure everything worked correctly. Finally, I installed any missing tools and customized the OS to my preferences.
