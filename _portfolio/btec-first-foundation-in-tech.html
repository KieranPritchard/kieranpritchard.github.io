                    This unit is based around how technology is used in our day to day life.
                    The unit covers many topics from cloud computing to online software, the lessons for this unit also had me working hands on with new tools and software.
                    The unit one of two that is graded based on an exam score, as supposed to assignments like all but one other of the units.
                    As you see the images I have chosen are the websites we used for revision, but I have also included screenshots of some of the software I was introduced to.

                    This unit like online world is based around a how technology is used in the world; however, unlike online world this unit is more about the technology works as opposed to how it is used.
                    This means it goes into computer componants, programming terminlogy, etc. This is the other exam unit that is based around an exam, not assignments. 
                    In the images below I have given you a view into the ways of revision that both exams use. The first are text books with examstyle questions and the other is a website called KnowItAllNinja.

                    This has been the unit of the course that has been my favorite to work through.
                    It allowed me to put to use my coding skills and work towards devloping this portfolio website.
                    This unit started by researching and comparing two different websites and then ended by building this website.

                    This was the unit which I found the most challenging, this was because this was the unit where I had no prior exposure to the tools.
                    The tools in question. Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, were tools I would of liked to have had used before but unfortunately pricing and other things ment I
                    I couldn't be exposed to it. To learn more <a href="{{ '/portfolio/btec-first-foundation-in-tech/digital-graphics-unit.html' | relative_url }}">click here</a>

                    This unit was the unit that I found the most interesting, this was because it was the unit that I had the most prior knowledge about.
                    This unit covered topics such as network topologies, network protocols, and network security. The unit was based around assignments and I was able to
                    use my prior knowledge to help me with the assignments. You can learn more about this unit if you <a href="{{ '/portfolio/btec-first-foundation-in-tech/networking-unit.html' | relative_url }}">click here</a>
