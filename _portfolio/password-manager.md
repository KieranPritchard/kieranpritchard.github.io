title: "Password Manager"
description: "This project showcases a Python-based password manager designed with Object-Oriented Programming. It serves as a demonstration of CRUD functionality, allowing for the secure storing, retrieval, and modification of passwords through persistent storage. By utilizing the cryptography library, the project highlights a strong focus on data integrity and standard security practices."

## Project Overview

### Disclaimer

This project was recently updated to take advantage of OOP (Object Orientated Programming). Alongside this, I updated comments and certain flows so it would be more focused around being a demonstration. My changes are detailed in a new file with the old code being in another for comparison reasons. 

### Objective:

To create a Cyber-Security based project, with a theme of password security and handling. I also wanted to pursue a project that uses CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete), to build skills with programming persistent storage. I later reprogrammed this to take advantage of Object Orientated Programming (OOP)

### Technology and Tools Used:

* **Language:** Python.
* **Framework/Library:** Cryptography.
* **Tools:** VS Code.

### Challenges Faced:

Firstly, there was a problem when converting the user input into hashes. this was fixed by changing '.update()' to the librarys '.digest()' function. Then finally I had a problem with the 'edit_credentials()' and 'delete_credentials()' luckily however, I had managed to come to the solution that is used in the program.

### Outcome:

Successfully created another cyber security project, using cyber security based external libraries and password security knowledge. Also managed to implement CRUD methodologies into a project.

## How to Use the Project

1. **Clone The Repository:**
* Download the project to your local device from github.
* You can access it here: [https://github.com/KieranPritchard/Password-Manager/tree/main](https://github.com/KieranPritchard/Password-Manager/tree/main)
2. **Set-up The Key:**
* run the script to generate an encryption key, named 'key.key'. 
* This automatically saves the file to the specified path.
* Please ensure the key is stored securely, as not only does it allow encryption to take place. its essential to making the program work.
3. **Login:**
* When you are prompted, enter the username and password. 
* The default values are hashed values in the code, you may modify these hashes if desired.
4. **Using The Password Manager:**
* After you have successfully logged in. You may access the following features:
        * **Adding a new credentials:** This allows you to input and save new credentials for various accounts.
        * **Viewing saved credentialls:** This decrypts and views stored passwords.
5. **Running The Code**
* Navigate to the directory storing the project. Then use this command: python 'Password_Manager.py'.
* Follow the onscreen prompts for login and accesssing features.
