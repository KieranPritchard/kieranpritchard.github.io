## Project Description

### Objective:

The goal of this project was to create a simple Linktree-style page for my personal use, allowing me to group all my important links under one umbrella for easy access.

### Features:

* Fully customizable colors, fonts, and styling using Tailwind CSS.
* Component-based structure built with ReactJS.
* Centralized access to all my social media profiles and important links.

### Tools and Languages:

* **Languages:** ReactJS, Tailwind CSS
* **Tools:** VS Code, Git

### Challenges Faced:

I initially created this project using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, I realized that approach wouldn’t be sustainable for my needs in the long run. I set the project aside for a while until I discovered a better solution through React. By switching to a component-based structure, I was able to make the project much easier to maintain, update, and expand over time.

### Outcome:

The final result is a clean, responsive, and fully customizable Linktree-style webpage that neatly groups all my social media and important links in one place. Using React’s reusable components and Tailwind’s utility first styling, I can quickly add, remove, or adjust links without rewriting large chunks of code. The project not only solves my original problem but also gave me valuable hands-on experience with React and Tailwind CSS, reinforcing my understanding of modern frontend development practices.
